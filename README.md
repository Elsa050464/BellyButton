# BellyButton
## Project Overview
Not everyone can understand python and coding, so we need tools to help our audience visualize the results of our analysis. Using the power of JavaScript, we will create the data visualization for the web which is active, accessible and interactive. JS has the ability to use buttons, dropdown and retrieve data from CSVs and APIs. 
This particular project is used to present Rosaâ€™s research about bacterial species found in the navel of the individual that will produce high quality meat to be synthesized that will taste like beef. Her laboratory is partnered with Improbable Beef.
